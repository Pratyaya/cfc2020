Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.

“We are at a critical point in the global response to COVID-19 – we need everyone to get involved in this massive effort to keep the world safe.”  _ Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

It is important to know and predict the spread of CORONA Virus for the administrative service provider and hospitals to keep the medical support for diseased ready and available on time.

As of last week, 114 countries have reported that 118,000 have contracted Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, known as SARS-CoV2. Nearly 4,300 people have died.
In the United States, where for weeks state and local laboratories could not test for the virus, just over 1,000 cases have been diagnosed and 29 people have died. But authorities here warn continuing limits on testing mean the full scale of spread in this country is not yet known.
